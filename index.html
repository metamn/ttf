      <h1>all-in-one solution / <span>A website which prints.</span></h1>
      
      <p>
        We have learned with great interest about the call made public by the OSI and we propose an all-in-one solution, a webpage to print, which believe will be the most optimal to achieve the desired outcomes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose this solution because the need to produce both print and online tools for data visualization and we believe that the time we can save on preparing these tools would be most valuable for our intended partners. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solution is unique as it proposes to allow you to freely add and manage projects.

      <!--
      <p>
        It is very fortunate you've requested for three variants. Each level is well founded and address a specific problem. Merging these levels into a final one will provide a reference point for similar projects in the region.
      </p>
      -->
      
      <p>
        #1 &mdash; First and most important we have found the design of the showcased projects are below international standards. Your message is not presented in the most pleasant way to readers. That's where we can help imediately: with a fresh look, a fresh design which delivers the message.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        #2 &mdash; Once the design is ready and the message is delivered the next step would be to enable people to play more with the information presented. And come back later to check out new things, pieces of knowledge. This requires to add a new, more interactive and usable layer to your existing solution. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        #3 &mdash; Finally, if there is a desire to reach highest standards we can consult our expert and re-design all infographics which are currently obsolete. In many cases wrong techniques are applied to good data.

            <p>
              We consider ourselves hackers: walking on, and pushing the limits of technology. We've grown up in closed systems now we value openness. In this spirit everything we create is built on open source.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Valid HTML5, CSS3, Javscript with SASS and Compass frameworks for cross browser compatibility. SVG, CSS3D, WebGL for animations and rich interactions. D3.js and Processing.js for interactive visualizations.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
              jsPDF, CSS3 Page Media Module for printing a website instead of closed source alternatives like Prince or Antenna House. You name it &mdash; we find an open source solution and integrate into your project.

            <h1>Responsive web design</h1>
            <p>
              Smartphones and tablets are first order citizens of the web like desktop monitors. We are always designing for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, making a website to print uses this same technology. Print is considered another `device` the website must adapt.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've started creating responsive web sites back in 2010 being one of the early birds. Now we move forward from screen to paper and maybe more beyond.

            <h1>Github: code, deliverables and hosting</h1>
            <p>
              We use Github from the beginning. It keeps our assets safe and collaboration easy. This current site is fully Github driven. All the source code and deliverables you can find in the repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover also the hosting is provided by Github, for free. Using new technologies liek Jekyll and Prose.io which we recommend to you. They offer 100% security, infinite scalability, and recently was adopted by U.S. healthcare.gov.

            <h1>A framework for visualizations</h1>
            <p>
              We are planning to collect in a repository the best visualization tools with a special focus on open source. You can use them freely in your future projects. It would be like a library where you can easily choose a technology and apply to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many hidden gems on the net. For example the timeline for project variants you've seen before is created through Google Docs. You fill out a form and get a link you insert into your webpage. And that's all.
            </p>
            <p>
              We think such tools will help you work better and faster in the future with your projects.

        As hackers we offer the best technology available today. Tested commercially.
