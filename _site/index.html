      <h1>all-in-one solution / <span>A website which prints.</span></h1>
      
      <p>
        We have learned with great interest about the call made public by the OSI and we propose an all-in-one solution, a webpage to print, which believe will be the most optimal to achieve the desired outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose this solution because the need to produce both print and online tools for data visualization and we believe that our intended partners would greatly benefit from our offer of a simple, easy-to-use technical solution for both their offline and online needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solution is unique as it proposes to allow you to freely add and manage projects in the future instead of offering a static solution.

      <p>
        #1 &mdash; First and most importantly, we have found the design of the showcased projects are below international standards. Your message can be presented in much better ways to your readers than it is presently done. That's where we can help immediately: with a fresh look, a fresh and modern design, which delivers the message.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        #2 &mdash; Once the design is ready and the message is delivered the next step would be to enable people to interact more with the information presented. Our goal would be to ensure your audienceâ€™s interest is maintained, website visitors and readers would come back later to check out new pieces of knowledge as they become public. This requires to add a new, more interactive and usable layer to your existing solution. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        #3 &mdash; Finally, we offer you the option to go beyond the present standards and consult our infographic expert in re-designing your presently employed visualization tools. This would ensure a better choice of techniques and tools are applied to your data, meeting the specificities and characteristic of each of the different projects that you are involved with.

            <p>
              Our technical solution is pushing the limits of present technology. Most of the present systems are closed systems but new developments stress the value openness and free access. In this spirit, everything we create is built on open source. Below you find a nonexhaustive list of the technologies we employ:
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Valid HTML5, CSS3, Javscript with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="SASS">SASS</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/" title="Compass">Compass</a> frameworks for cross browser compatibility. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" title="SVG">SVG</a>, <a href="http://css-3d.org/" title="CSS3D">CSS3D</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" title="WebGL">WebGL</a> for animations and rich interactions. <a href="http://d3js.org/" title="D3.js">D3.js</a> and <a href="http://processingjs.org/" title="Processing.js">Processing.js</a> for interactive visualizations.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <a href="http://parall.ax/products/jspdf" title="jsPDF">jsPDF</a>, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/building-books-with-css3" title="CSS3 Page Media Module">CSS3 Page Media Module</a> for printing a website instead of closed source alternatives like <a href="http://www.princexml.com/" title="Prince">Prince XML</a> or <a href="http://www.antennahouse.com/" title="Antenna House">Antenna House</a>. You name it &mdash; and we'll find an open source solution and integrate into your project.

        <dd>
          <div>
            <h1>Responsive web & print design</h1>
            <p>
              Our first priority is to ensure a responsive web design because desktop monitors have been joined by smartphones and tablets as first order citizens of the web. Our design always follows the parameters of cross-device responsibility to ensure that the message is delivered with the most responsive technology for the given device.
            </p>
            <p>
              This cross-device responsivity of our product enables us to offer you our solution that is  a website to print uses. The concept behind our solution is to consider printing just another `device` the website must adapt to, which means that your message will not only be crystal clear on desktop monitors or tablets but can also be printed without any interaction needed from the user. This will mean a substantial reduction of production costs for any leaflets or brochures as different templates for the print product would be readily available for any user of our solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team started creating responsive web sites back in 2010 being one of the earliest companies to use these technologies. Now we move forward from screen to paper and maybe more beyond.

            <h1>Github: code, deliverables and hosting</h1>
            <p>
              We use <a href="https://github.com/" title="Github">Github</a> in our solution. It keeps our assets safe and collaboration among different users easy. This current site is fully Github driven. You can find in the <a href="https://github.com/metamn/ttf/tree/gh-pages" title="OSF TTF Github repository">repository</a> all the source code and deliverables.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, the hosting is provided by Github, for free. We also recommend to use of other new technologies like Jekyll and Prose.io that offer 100% security, infinite scalability. We believe this will ensure that your solution remains not easily tailorable to your needs in the future but will also ensure you the benefits of these collaborative technologies, the value of which was recently recognized even by the <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/new-healthcare-gov-is-open-and-cms-free/" title="healthcare.gov is cms-free">U.S. healthcare government</a> that also recently adopted these.

            <p>
             We are planning to collect in a repository the best visualization tools with a special focus on open source. Our solution would allow you to use these freely in your future projects and select among them based on the needs of the given project. The repository would be like a library where you can easily choose a technology and apply it to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many hidden gems on the net. For example the <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/" title="Timeline.js">timeline</a> for project variants you've seen before is created through Google Docs. You fill out a form and get a link you insert into your webpage. And that's all.
            </p>
            <p>
              We think such tools will help you work better and faster in the future with any of your projects.
